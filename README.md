# cooling-flow-model-
This work is on modelling of local cooling flows in astrophysical plasma of the Circumgalactic medium and comparison with Illustris TNG50 Cosmological simulation.

This repo contains the codes and the data used in the paper "Cooling flows around cold clouds in the circumgalactic medium:theory & comparison with TNG50"
The larger sized data used in the code and cannot be uploaded to Github due to size restrictions can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2xM4T_U-emlXu8vRK23LeGUMgklnoFw/view?usp=sharing

The Illustris TNG50 data that has been used is publicly hosted at: https://www.tng-project.org/
